# Triage Examples

Real triage decisions from the issue history, with reasoning.
Use these as reference for how to classify similar issues.

## Example 1: Clear Compiler/ONNX2EP Bug
**Issue:** #18492 "Cannot capture the entire model: Resize"
- **Labels assigned:** `bug, Compiler/ONNX2EP`
- **Assigned to:** Compiler/ONNX2EP team
- **Reasoning:** "Cannot capture the entire model" is a signature ONNX EP compilation error where QNN EP fails to capture an ONNX operator. The op name (Resize) confirms it's a missing/broken op in the EP.
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Similar:** #18490 (Identity), #18376 (BatchNormalization), #18353 (GEMM)

## Example 2: Context Binary Runtime Failure
**Issue:** #18300 "context binary exit code 14: Wrong number of Parameters 6"
- **Labels assigned:** `bug, Compiler/ONNX2EP`
- **Assigned to:** Compiler/ONNX2EP team
- **Reasoning:** "context binary exit code" means a compiled QNN context binary failed during on-device execution. Exit code 14 indicates a parameter count mismatch. This is a compiler bug producing invalid binaries.
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Similar:** #18299 (exit code 15: GatherPatches)

## Example 3: ORT Version Regression (ambiguous)
**Issue:** #18531 "Possible Regression in ORT 1.24.3 vs 1.24.1 on X2 Elite CRD only"
- **Labels assigned:** `P0` (no team label!)
- **Assigned to:** Compiler/ONNX2EP team
- **Reasoning:** ORT regression on a specific device (X2 Elite CRD). Could be `ONNXRuntime` or `Compiler/ONNX2EP` or `Devices` (device-specific). Assigned to Compiler/ONNX2EP because they own ORT perf investigations. The "CRD only" qualifier suggests it may also need device team input.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — ambiguous between runtime and device teams
- **Better labeling would be:** `P0, ONNXRuntime` or `P0, Compiler/ONNX2EP, Devices`

## Example 4: ONNX2TF Cross-Format Regression
**Issue:** #18530 "ONNX2TF Regression: 5+ Matmul created that is falling back to CPU"
- **Labels assigned:** `P0` (no team label!)
- **Assigned to:** Compiler Service team
- **Reasoning:** ONNX2TF is a conversion pathway in the Compiler Service. Matmul ops falling back to CPU means the converter isn't properly mapping ops to accelerated implementations. This is `Compiler Service` territory, not `Compiler/ONNX2EP`.
- **Confidence:** HIGH for Compiler Service
- **Better labeling would be:** `P0, Compiler Service`

## Example 5: Nightly Failure (auto-filed, needs triage)
**Issue:** #18544 "QAI Hub Models Nightly Tests Failed - 2026-04-08"
- **Labels assigned:** `P0, ai-hub-models`
- **Assigned to:** (unassigned — czar picks up)
- **Reasoning:** Auto-filed by CI. The czar needs to read the CI logs to determine root cause: could be model code change, dependency update, compiler regression, or infrastructure issue. Initial label is correct; downstream triage happens after log analysis.
- **Confidence:** HIGH for initial label, further triage needed

## Example 6: GPU Nightly (specific sub-team)
**Issue:** #18447 "GPU nightly Tests Failed - 2026-04-03"
- **Labels assigned:** `P0, ai-hub-models, gen-ai`
- **Assigned to:** gen-ai team
- **Reasoning:** GPU nightly tests are a specific subset of model tests focused on GenAI models with GPU inference. The `gen-ai` label distinguishes from regular model nightly failures.
- **Confidence:** HIGH

## Example 7: Deployment Failure (auto-filed)
**Issue:** #18461 "Deployment Build&Test Failure April 3, 2026"
- **Labels assigned:** `P0, Deployment`
- **Assigned to:** Deployment team
- **Reasoning:** Post-deployment test failure. Title pattern is consistent and auto-filed. Deployment team rotation handles these.
- **Confidence:** HIGH

## Example 8: Infrastructure OOM
**Issue:** #18040 "Nightly scorecard OOMKilled (exit code 137) in torch_3_of_4"
- **Labels assigned:** `P0, bug`
- **Assigned to:** Cloud services team
- **Reasoning:** Exit code 137 = OOMKilled by Linux kernel. "torch_3_of_4" identifies the CI split. This is an infrastructure issue (job memory limits too low), not a model bug.
- **Confidence:** HIGH for Cloud services
- **Better labeling would be:** `P0, bug, Cloud services`

## Example 9: Accuracy Gap (model team)
**Issue:** #18303 "Large accuracy gap between published benchmarks and scorecard eval for 16 models"
- **Labels assigned:** `P2, ai-hub-models`
- **Assigned to:** ai-hub-models team
- **Reasoning:** Discrepancy between published benchmarks and actual scorecard evaluation results. This is a model validation issue owned by the ai-hub-models team.
- **Confidence:** HIGH

## Example 10: LiteRT / Tungsten
**Issue:** #18547 "litert build path is showing up in logs"
- **Labels assigned:** `Tungsten, P2`
- **Assigned to:** Tungsten team
- **Reasoning:** LiteRT build issue. "litert" keyword maps directly to Tungsten team. Build path leaking into logs is a packaging/build issue.
- **Confidence:** HIGH

## Example 11: Batch Norm Regression (ambiguous)
**Issue:** #18511 "Regression: Possible miss in Batch Norm folding in ORT"
- **Labels assigned:** `P0` (no team label!)
- **Assigned to:** ONNXRuntime team
- **Reasoning:** Batch normalization folding is an ONNX Runtime optimization pass. "Possible miss" means the optimization isn't being applied, causing a perf regression. Could be `ONNXRuntime` or `Compiler/ONNX2EP`.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Better labeling would be:** `P0, ONNXRuntime` or `P0, Compiler/ONNX2EP`

## Example 12: Device Enablement
**Issue:** #18352 "[Nord Robotics] Enable in AI Hub Models"
- **Labels assigned:** `P1, Blocked, Devices`
- **Assigned to:** ai-hub-models team
- **Reasoning:** New device (Nord Robotics / QAM8797P) needs to be added to AI Hub Models. The `Blocked` label indicates a dependency on other enablement steps. Part of a larger epic (#18347).
- **Confidence:** HIGH

## Example 13: AIMET Quantization Bug — NOT Our Code (CRITICAL)
**Nightly failure:** `ddrnet23_slim::test_export[w8a8-qnn_dlc-cs_8_elite]`
- **Error:** `ValueError: Output 'mask' from get_output_spec() not found in compiled model metadata. Available outputs: ['QcQuantizeOp_mask_q']`
- **Mentions:** QNN, quantization, DLC, compiled model metadata
- **Key signal:** `QcQuantizeOp_` prefix + `_q` suffix = **AIMET quantization artifacts**
- **WRONG triage:** `ai-hub-models` — "our code is too strict, fix merge_output_metadata()"
- **WRONG triage:** `Compiler/ONNX2EP` — "compiler renamed the outputs"
- **CORRECT triage:** `Quantization` — AIMET is leaking internal quantization op names into the compiled model's output names. AIMET should produce outputs with the original names (`mask`), not wrapped names (`QcQuantizeOp_mask_q`).
- **Confidence:** HIGH for Quantization
- **Real-world resolution:** Filed as tetracode#19066 + AIMET-4534. Assigned to Quantization team.
- **Lesson:** `QcQuantizeOp_` prefix is the signature of an AIMET bug. Do NOT propose "fuzzy match" workarounds in our code — that would mask the real issue. The fix belongs in AIMET.
- **How to verify:** Search tetracode: `gh issue list --repo qcom-ai-hub/tetracode --search "<model_name> AIMET" --label Quantization --state open`

## Example 14: Dependency Wheel Failure
**Nightly failure:** `pipertts_de/en/it::environment_setup` on py3.12 + py3.13
- **Error:** `Install QAIHM[dev,pipertts_*] (wheel) failed — piper-phonemize==1.1.0 has no matching wheel`
- **CORRECT triage:** `ai-hub-models` (model owner from the PR that added pipertts)
- **Reasoning:** Missing wheels for certain Python versions/platforms is a model dependency issue. The fix is either adding supported wheels, pinning compatible versions, or marking the model as unsupported on those Python versions.
- **Confidence:** HIGH

## Example 15: Link Job Failure — Compiler/ONNX2EP
**Issue:** #19030 "CVT w8a16_mixed_fp16 AOT fails, but JIT works"
- **Labels assigned:** `Compiler/ONNX2EP`
- **Reasoning:** Link job (ctx-bin-gen) fails with dtype mismatch for Depthwise Conv2d (Fp16 activation + Int8 weights). The DLC compiles fine but the AOT link step fails. Link job failures route to `Compiler/ONNX2EP`.
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Lesson:** Link job failures route to `Compiler/ONNX2EP`.

## Example 16: Link Job Failure — ai-hub-models (disabled model)
**Nightly failure:** `pipertts_*` link jobs failed on cs_8_elite and cs_x_elite
- **Error:** 6 pipertts encoder link jobs failed
- **Context:** Model was made unpublished in same nightly window (commit `47c58c40`)
- **CORRECT triage:** `ai-hub-models` — test infrastructure should skip link jobs for disabled/unpublished models
- **WRONG triage:** `Compiler/ONNX2EP` — this is not a compiler bug
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Lesson:** When a model is disabled/unpublished and its jobs start failing, the fix is in our test infrastructure (skip the jobs), not in the compiler.

## Example 17: TFLite Regression Coinciding with QAIRT Bump — Compiler/ONNX2EP
**Issue:** #18933 "SINet TFLite regression"
- **Labels assigned:** `P1, Compiler/ONNX2EP`
- **Reasoning:** TFLite regression appeared at same time as QAIRT 2.45 upgrade. TFLite ships its on-device compilation with QAIRT — all paths must compile to context binary on device.
- **WRONG triage:** `Tungsten` — this is not a device runtime issue
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Lesson:** TFLite regressions that coincide with QAIRT version bumps → `Compiler/ONNX2EP`.

## Example 18: Float Accuracy Drop on Specific Device — Compiler/ONNX2EP
**Issue:** #18939 "Swin accuracy regression on Samsung Galaxy S25"
- **Labels assigned:** `Compiler/ONNX2EP`
- **Context:** Float precision accuracy drops on S25 with ONNX runtime, other devices fine
- **WRONG triage:** `ai-hub-models` (accuracy issue)
- **CORRECT triage:** `Compiler/ONNX2EP` — device-specific float accuracy drop = EP execution issue
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Lesson:** Accuracy regressions that are device-specific AND float precision on ONNX runtime → `Compiler/ONNX2EP`, not `ai-hub-models`.

## Anti-Pattern: What NOT to Do

### Don't assume stack trace location determines ownership
A stack trace in `qai_hub_models/` does NOT always mean it's our bug. For example, output names being incorrect results in a raise in our code, but the root cause is in the compiler stack (the compiler renamed outputs incorrectly).

Check: "What produced the bad state?" — not "Where did the code crash?"
- Bad data from compiler (e.g., renamed outputs) → compiler team, even if our code raises
- Our logic error processing valid compiler output → ai-hub-models

### Don't confuse ONNX EP compilation with ONNX Runtime
- "Cannot capture" / "subgraph" / "exit code" → `Compiler/ONNX2EP` (compilation phase)
- "ORT version regression" / "segments" → `ONNXRuntime` (runtime phase)

### Link job failures → Compiler/ONNX2EP
Link job failures (DLC → context binary) should be routed to `Compiler/ONNX2EP`. This is consistent with the error patterns routing.

Exception: If a link failure is caused by our code sending the wrong input (e.g., "Input model must be a QNN DLC model"), route to `ai-hub-models`.

### Don't assign nightly failures to a specific person
The czar rotates weekly. Assign to the `ai-hub-models` label and let the current czar pick up.

## Example 19: GitHub 502 on License URL — NOT Transient (Repo Transfer)
**Issue:** tetracode#19559 "[QAIHM Nightly] Test Failures - 2026-05-29"
- **Error:** `test_info_yaml` — `llama_v2_7b_chat` license URL unreachable (GitHub 502, "too many 502 error responses")
- **Agent triage:** Classified as transient GitHub 502 — suggested re-run
- **Actual fix:** PR #3410 updated the URL from `facebookresearch/llama` to `meta-llama/llama` (repo was transferred)
- **WRONG triage:** "Sporadic — transient GitHub connectivity. Re-run."
- **CORRECT triage:** `ai-hub-models` — The repo was transferred; old URL redirects but sometimes returns 502 under load. Fix the URL.
- **Key signal:** Only ONE URL fails, rest of test suite passes. Transient 502 would affect multiple GitHub URLs simultaneously.
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Lesson:** A URL with redirect hops (e.g. transferred repo) is more vulnerable to GitHub 5xx flake. If a single GitHub URL keeps 502'ing while other GitHub URLs work, check whether the URL redirects — pointing at the canonical URL drops the hop and reduces exposure. Re-run alone is not enough.

## Example 20: S3 Test Asset Change Causing Model Test Assertion Failure
**Issue:** tetracode#19498 "[QAIHM Nightly] Test Failures - 2026-05-27"
- **Error:** `trocr::test_predict_text_from_image` — model produces completely wrong text vs expected
- **Agent triage:** Suspected PR #3359 (serialize() refactor) as HIGH — first commit after last passing
- **Actual fix:** Test images on S3 were replaced without updating expected values (human confirmed)
- **WRONG triage:** Blame the serialize() PR (code change)
- **CORRECT triage:** `ai-hub-models` — S3 test assets were changed out-of-band. No code change caused this.
- **Key signal:** Cross-version failure (py3.10, 3.11, 3.13 all fail identically) + model produces radically different output (not a subtle regression) = input data changed, not model logic
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Lesson:** When a model test produces wildly different output across ALL Python versions simultaneously, and the error is in the assertion (expected vs actual), check whether test assets (images, reference data on S3) were modified. Git blame won't show this since assets live outside the repo.

## Example 21: GitHub Actions CDN Outage — Pure Transient
**Issue:** tetracode#19449 "[QAIHM Nightly] Test Failures - 2026-05-26"
- **Error:** 12 jobs failed at "Set up job" step — `An action could not be found at the URI https://codeload.github.com/actions/checkout/tar.gz/...`
- **Agent triage:** Correctly identified as transient GitHub Actions CDN outage. No code fix needed.
- **Labels:** `P0, ai-hub-models` (auto-filed)
- **Resolution:** Re-run. Also PR #3380 added logic to avoid filing false P0 "Workbench Job Failures" issues when verify jobs crash before checking workbench jobs.
- **Key signal:** ALL failed jobs have identical "Set up job" error + `codeload.github.com` in URL + some Python versions passed (timing-dependent)
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Lesson:** When multiple jobs fail at the "Set up job" step with `codeload.github.com` errors, it's always a GitHub CDN outage. The related tetracode#19448 (Workbench Job Failures) was a false alarm — no workbench jobs actually ran.
